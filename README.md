# Project Strategy Overview
## Key Business Questions to Answer:
1. Which aircraft makes/models have the lowest accident rates and injury severity?

2. What operational factors (purpose, engine type, weather) correlate with safety?

3. Which aircraft characteristics predict better safety outcomes?

## Recommended Analysis Approach:
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
2. Handle missing values in key columns like Injury.Severity, Aircraft.damage, Weather.Condition

3. Filter to relevant time period (last 20-30 years for more modern aircraft)

4. Create derived metrics: total accidents per aircraft model, injury rates, etc.


## 2. Core Analysis Directions
``Aircraft Safety Ranking:``

1. Group by Make and Model to calculate:

a. Total accidents per model

b. Fatality rates

c. Injury severity scores

d. Aircraft damage frequency

#Operational Risk Factors:

a. Analyze Purpose.of.flight (commercial vs private risk profiles)

b. Examine Weather.Condition impact on accident severity

c. Study Engine.Type and Number.of.Engines safety correlations

Temporal Trends:

Safety improvements over time by aircraft type

Modern vs older aircraft performance

3. Potential Business Recommendations
Based on typical aviation safety data, you might recommend:

Specific Aircraft Models with proven safety records

Operational Guidelines (weather limitations, flight purposes)

Technical Specifications (engine types, safety features)

4. Visualization Ideas for Presentation
Safety Score by Aircraft Model (Bar chart)

Accident Severity by Flight Purpose (Stacked bar chart)

Weather Condition Impact (Pie/bar chart)

Safety Trends Over Time (Line graph)

5. Interactive Dashboard Features
Filter by aircraft make/model

Toggle between different safety metrics

Compare commercial vs private operations

View by time period

Getting Started Checklist:
Create GitHub repository using one of the suggested templates

Load and explore the dataset structure

Identify data quality issues and cleaning needs

Formulate specific hypotheses to test

Begin exploratory data analysis

Draft presentation outline

The key is to focus on actionable insights that directly address the business problem: which aircraft represent the lowest risk for a company new to aviation operations.
